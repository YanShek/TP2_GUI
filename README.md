# Course Registration Server

A Java-based server application for managing course registrations and retrieving course information.

## Overview

1. **Course Registration**: Accepts and processes user registrations for specific courses.
2. **Course Loading**: Retrieves and sends the list of available courses for a specified session.

The server is built using Java's networking and I/O capabilities, featuring a modular design for easy scalability and maintenance.
